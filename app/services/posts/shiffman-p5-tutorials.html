<p>I’m learning p5.js by watching Daniel Shiffman’s p5 tutorials. My first p5 app is an app of the p5 demos. FYI, it is so much easier to do animations using p5 vs CSS.<p>

<ul>
  <li>The menu on the right is all done in p5.</li>
  <li>Clicking on an item loads a particular demo in the iframe.</li>
  <li>p5 handles adding the menu the DOM and the click events.</li>
</ul>
